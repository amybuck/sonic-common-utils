/**
 *  Instantiate a generic RBT tree. This implementation of RBT can operate on
 *  any arbitrary keys. If you have a key that can't be accomadated within
 *  ULONG then talk to the owner of this module.
 *
 *  Two classes of routines are provided to the users of RBT. The first
 *  and recommended set are the calls that start with std_rbtree prefix. The
 *  second set of calls start with std_rbtree prefix. The main difference
 *  being that the former hides the RNT node
 *  entirely from the user. That is the user is never required to either
 *  allocate or free RBT node. The user is required to maintain the
 *  user node that hangs off the RBT node. The key is contained entirely
 *  within the user node. No key is maintained within the RBT node. The
 *  access to the key is provided by giving the offset information at
 *  the time of init. So it is extremely important that the user nodes
 *  have proper allocation and key positioned at the specified offset.
 *  Otherwise, RBT tree will not work and can cause crash.
 *
 *  @param rbtt_name Pointer to character string for name of this tree.
 *  @param keyoffset Offset in number of bytes from the start of the
 *                   user node at which key is located.
 *  @param keylength Length of the key in bytes. This parameter ignored if the
 *                   compare function is one of RBT_ULONG_KEY or RBT_INT_KEY.
 *                   The only purpose of taking this parameter is allow
 *                   the RBT tester routines to be able to attach to any
 *                   user RBT for debugging. Note that the tester debugging
 *                   will work only when the key is contigous. That is,
 *                   RBT as such support non-contigous keys, but the tester
 *                   may not be used for debugging assistance.
 *  @param rbtt_malloc User provided malloc routine of RBT internal node
 *                     allocation. If this parameter is NULL, then malloc
 *                     from libc is used.
 *  @param rbtt_free User provided free routine for freeing RBT internal
 *                   node. If this parameter is NULL then free from libc
 *                   is used.
 *  @param rbtt_compare User is provided with two predefined compare
 *                      functions: RBT_ULONG_KEY for unsigned long
 *                      keys and RBT_INT_KEY for integer keys.
 *                      Alternatively user may choose to provide his own
 *                      compare function. In this case, the compare must
 *                      return a value of -1 if the first data node key
 *                      is strictly less than the second data node key,
 *                      1 if the first data node key is strictly greater
 *                      than the second data node key, and 0 in case
 *                      when first data key equals second data key. Also
 *                      note that the first parameter to the compare
 *                      callback function is the offset provided to RBT
 *                      at instantiation.
 *  @return rbtree_handle - A handle to the instantiated tree. User must
 *          maintain this for all furture operations on the tree.
